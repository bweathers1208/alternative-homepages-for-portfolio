# Alternatve Homepages For Portfolio

Recently I had the opportunity to have my portfolio website reviewed by multiple professionals in the industry. As a student I took their critiques to heart in the best way, and this repository is for me to play around with some various options as far as layout, font, total feel of the site, etc. and decide what I want based on that. Any and all feedback welcomed!
